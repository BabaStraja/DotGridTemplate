# DotGridTemplate
Don't want to buy a whole dot grid notebook? Print a few papers yourself with these dog grid print templates

## Intended paper sizes: 
The templates are only optimized for A4 paper size for now, feel free to use for different paper sizes but see how you like the output and tweak accordingly

## Full vs half vs quarter split
I use the quarter splits as my weekly todo's â€“ I print them on both sides and fold them twice

## Darkness
I use the lightest, but you do you
